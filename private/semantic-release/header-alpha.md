## âš  Warning âš 

ðŸš§ This version is **not ready for production use**. ðŸš§

This is the alpha release of the next major version of the MyParcel WooCommerce plugin. We've rewritten the plugin from scratch, using the [frontend] and [backend] of the MyParcel PDK (Plugin Development Kit).

For a safer experience, we recommend you to use the stable or release candidate version of the plugin. You can find the stable version in the [WordPress plugin directory]. The release candidate versions can be found in the [releases] section of this repository. They are versioned with a `-rc` suffix.

If you do choose to install this version, we would love to hear your feedback. Please report any issues you encounter using the [Bug report for v5.0.0-alpha.x form] or by sending an email to [support@myparcel.nl]
