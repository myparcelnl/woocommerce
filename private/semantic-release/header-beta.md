## ðŸš§ This version is not ready for production use ðŸš§

This is the beta release of MyParcel for WooCommerce v5.x. We've rewritten the entire plugin from scratch, using the [MyParcel Plugin Development Kit].

For a less bug-prone experience, we recommend you use the stable or release candidate versions of the plugin instead. You can find the stable version in the [WordPress plugin directory]. The release candidate versions can be found in the [releases] section of this repository. They are versioned with a `-rc` suffix.

If you do choose to install this version, we would love to hear your feedback. Please report any issues you encounter using the [Bug report for v5.0.0-beta.x form] or by sending an email to [support@myparcel.nl]. Use it in production at your own risk.
