### Making JavaScript or CSS changes
1. Set up Node if you haven't already: https://nodejs.org/
2. Install npm packages
    ```shell script
    $ npm i
    ```
2. Make your changes
   * Optional: Run the following command to rebuild assets on every code change:
   ```shell script
   $ gulp watch
   ```
   > :warning:Ô∏è **Note**: When building with `gulp watch` assets are **not** run through Babel. This type of build will not be compatible with older browsers.
                                                                                                               
3. Test your changes
    * Locally, if the source directory is inside your `<wordpress>/wp-content` folder.
        ```shell script
        $ gulp
        ```
    * By uploading a `.zip` file

        This builds all assets and puts all necessary files into `woocommerce-myparcel.zip`. Upload this file to your WordPress website to install the plugin.
        ```shell script
        $ gulp zip
        ```
    * By uploading the source folder
        
        We don't recommend uploading the whole source folder to where your website is hosted, but it does work. Run the following command and copy the whole plugin folder to your website's `wp-content` folder.
        ```shell script
        $ gulp
        ```
        A better solution is to follow the instructions for installation using a `.zip` file, then extracting the zip yourself and uploading its contents to your website's `wp-content` folder.
